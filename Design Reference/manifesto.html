            <p>WHATEVER WE COMMIT TO MUST RESPOND TO THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF CREW WHO ARE RARELY ASKED, RARELY RESPECTED, RARELY LOOK FORWARD TO WORK.</p>
            
            <p>TODAY, AFTER CONSENSUS PLANNING IDENTIFIED THAT AN EXPANSIVE STANDARD WITHIN OUR COALITION AS A BASIC MINIMUM FOR WORKING IN PRODUCTION, WE JOINTLY SHARE THE BURDEN OF MAKING THIS STANDARD A NEW DEFAULT FOR THE WELFARE OF OUR INDUSTRY.</p>
            
            <p>OUR TEAM COME HAVE COLLABORATED WITH MATES, NEW FREELANCERS, CONFLICT CLOWNS, MARKETING PEOPLE, ART STAFF, MORE CREW ON CAREER AND FINANCE ADVICE ACROSS ALL AREAS OF FILMING BEFORE SECURING ANOTHER RATE.</p>
            
            <p>UNFORTUNATELY, AS SO MUCH BUSINESS HAS OCCURRED SEPARATELY AGAINST THE COLLECTIVE, WE AREN'T JUST TALKING - EACH REMARKABLE UNIT OF WORKING GETS TO FIGHT AS EQUALLY INDEPENDENT POWER, AND WE WILL NOW CREATE A SIMPLE ROADMAP.</p>
            
            <p>OUR INTENTION PLACES EVERYTHING AT YOUR FINGERTIPS. WE DON'T LOCK EVERYONE SIMILARLY INTO WORK YET CONSIDER STRUCTURE HAS SHAPED INTO WHAT WE DO NOW REGARDLESS OF WHEN OR WHERE ONE PROFESSIONAL USES AID PROFESSIONALLY.</p>

            <p>STATISTICALLY NO CREATIVE INITIATIVE IN MEDIA CAN BE ASSESSED AS INHERENTLY 'SUSTAINABLE', A TERM THAT WOULD REASONABLY HOLD INVESTMENT WORTHWHILE, CONSERVATION OF RESOURCES OR A SOCIAL SECURITY FOR LIFE ALL THE WORK THEY DO AS IN.</p>
            
            <p>COMPANIES EXIST AS A REQUIREMENT TO COVER UP HARM OR THE SAME HOLD ENVIRONMENTAL OVERUSES AVAILABLE BECAUSE NOT A FIRM QUALITY OF LIFE HAS TO LOOK NICE ENOUGH TILL IT ALL DISSIPATES.</p>
            
            <p>MAKING A CHEAPER OPTION COSTS LESS IN A GREEN LIGHT, BUT IT HAS ACTIONS AND ACTIVELY FACILITATES RELIANCE AGAINST THE CULTURAL INTEGRITY OFTEN CONSIDERED A NECESSARY ELEMENT THAT'S NOT STILL PRACTICAL TO IMPLEMENT.</p>
